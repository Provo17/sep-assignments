Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using linear search?

It will take seven iterations to reach the letter G.

Given the alphabetically sorted collection in this checkpoint, how many iterations would it take to find the value G using binary search?

It would take 3 iterations using binary search.

Calculate fib(10), fib(11), fib(12) by hand.

fib() = 55
fib() = 89
fib() = 144



Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose between linear search and binary search? 
Would you use an iterative or recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.
