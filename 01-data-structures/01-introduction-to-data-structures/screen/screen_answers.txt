•How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
•If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
•What other real-world data can each structure represent?

1. Developers can access the data by using the "at" method to retrieve the data at each pixel of the screen matrix. They can create a new pixel object with their
desired color options and use the "insert" method to enter the pixel into the matrix.

1.	By using the insert method, a developer can create a new pixel with a desired color and insert it in to the matrix using x and y coordinates. The at method allows a developer to return the coordinates of a pixel using the coordinates of the matrix object.
2.	A loop can be created to search the matrix object for a specific pixel. The matrix object is a 2D array therefore, the loop would first need to search for the x value return it and then for the y value.
3.	The matrix object could represent a map with specific locations, a way to plot points for graphs, or anything that could be represented using a coordinate plane.
