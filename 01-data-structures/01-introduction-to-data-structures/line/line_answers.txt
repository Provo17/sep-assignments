•How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?
•If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?
•What other real-world data can each structure represent?

1.	I used an array as my data structure. Using Ruby’s built in methods such as push and delete a developer can add and remove items from the array. Data can also be manipulated by using an items index.
2.	The developer would use the items index.
3.	This data structure is great for lists of items. Therefore, using it to represent things like grocery lists or a store’s physical inventory would be appropriate.
