1.	What is Spatial Locality and why does it benefit performance?
Spatial locality refers to the of data that a processor choses to access based on the time retrieved and the location relative to the current reference. It is most likely that data in the nearby memory locations will be referenced soon. Therefore, to increase performance, it is common to attempt to guess the size and shape of the area surrounding the current reference to prepare faster access.

2.	Compare the performance of an Array to a Linked List using the Benchmark module.
•	Compare the time it takes to create a 10,000 item Array to appending 10,000 items to a Linked List.
•	Compare the time it takes to access the 5000th element of the Array and the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
•	Compare the time it takes to remove the 5000th element from the Array to removing the 5000th Node in the Linked List.
Results:
array
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.003972)
list
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.005166)

5000th item in array
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.000002)
5000th item in list
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.000257)

Delete 5000th element
  0.000000   0.000000   0.000000 (0.000009)
Delete 5000th node
  0.010000   0.000000   0.010000 (0.000636)
  
Given the benchmark  report an Array is a better performing data structure.
